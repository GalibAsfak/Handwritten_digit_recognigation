# Digit Recognition from Screen Capture

This program captures a portion of the screen, processes the image, and uses a pre-trained model to recognize handwritten digits.

## Features
- Real-time screen capture of a specified region
- Image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, thresholding)
- Digit prediction using a pre-trained machine learning model
- Display of prediction results on the captured image

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
